# time-series-Explainability

## What has been done so far?
1- Dataset is found on Kaggle <br />
2- Dataset processed to be easier "daily" dataset instead of "hourly" <br />
2- Data PreProcessing is fully completed for 3 different tasks <br />
4- 3 simple Machine Learning model has been implemented and tuned for predictions <br /> 
5- Explain the first model (SHAP for Explaining RandomForestRegressor) <br /> <br />

## What is next?
1- Explain the second model (Lime for Explaining XGBoost) _29.05.2020_ <br />
2- Explain the third model (LimeForTime for Explaining RidgeRegression) _05.06.2020_ <br />
3- Increase the readability of the notebook for presenting <br /> <br />
