# time-series-Explainability

## What has been done so far?
1- Dataset is found on Kaggle <br />
2- Dataset processed to be easier "daily" dataset instead of "hourly" <br />
3- To do training, 3 different style of datasets are created by the simplified dataset <br />
4- 3 simple Machine Learning model is being used for predictions <br />
5- 3 different XAI tools has been used to explain the most effective columns on dataset <br /> <br />

## What is next?
1- Make XGBoost work accurately. (currently it is not performing well) <br />
1- Implement Lime and Lime for time <br />
1- Explain the XGBoost and LinearRegression models <br />
